# Sentiment_analysis_using_BERT

BERT, which stands for **Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers**, is a state-of-the-art natural language processing (NLP) model developed by researchers at Google. Introduced in 2018, BERT has since become a foundational model in the NLP field, thanks to its impressive performance on a variety of tasks.

Here's a breakdown of BERT and how it works:

### 1. **Transformers Architecture**:
BERT is built on the Transformers architecture. The main innovation of the Transformers architecture is the self-attention mechanism, which allows the model to weigh the significance of different words in a sentence relative to a given word. This allows for a richer understanding of context.

### 2. **Bidirectionality**:
Traditional models like the LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) and the GRU (Gated Recurrent Units) read text in sequences, either from left to right or right to left. BERT, on the other hand, reads text bidirectionally. This means that for each word, it considers the entire context of the word by looking at the words that come before and after it.

### 3. **Pre-training on Large Text Corpora**:
BERT is pre-trained on a massive amount of text. The pre-training process involves two main tasks:
  - **Masked Language Model (MLM)**: Random words in a sentence are replaced with a `[MASK]` token. BERT tries to predict the original word of the masked word based on its context.
  - **Next Sentence Prediction**: Given two sentences, BERT tries to predict if the second sentence is the subsequent sentence of the first in the original document.

Through these tasks, BERT learns contextual word representations.

### 4. **Fine-tuning for Specific Tasks**:
After pre-training, BERT can be fine-tuned on a smaller annotated dataset specific to a particular NLP task (e.g., sentiment analysis, question-answering). This involves adding an output layer for the specific task, and training on the task-specific data.

### 5. **Embeddings**:
BERT uses WordPiece embeddings, which allow it to efficiently represent out-of-vocabulary words.

### 6. **Positional Encodings**:
Since BERT doesn't inherently understand the order of words, it uses positional encodings to give the model information about the position of a word in a sequence.

### How BERT Works:
1. **Input Transformation**: A sentence (or pair of sentences) is tokenized into WordPiece tokens. Special tokens `[CLS]` (for classification tasks) and `[SEP]` (to separate sentence pairs) are added. Then, the tokens are transformed into vectors using embeddings.
2. **Self-Attention**: Through multiple layers of self-attention mechanisms in the transformer, BERT can weigh the importance of different words in a sentence relative to any given word.
3. **Aggregating Context**: As the model processes the input data through its layers (BERT-base has 12 layers, while BERT-large has 24), it continually aggregates and refines contextual information.
4. **Output**: For classification tasks, the output from the `[CLS]` token is used. For token-level tasks (e.g., named entity recognition), the output from each token is used.

BERT's ability to understand the context bidirectionally and its deep architecture allow it to set new standards in various NLP benchmarks.
